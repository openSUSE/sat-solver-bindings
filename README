SAT-Solver

Using a Satisfyability Solver to compute package dependencies.

See http://idea.opensuse.org/content/ideas/fast-installation-tool
for the motivation.


This code is based on two major, but independent, blocks

1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package
   and dependency information.
   
2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
   computing package dependencies.


Google for 'sat solver' to get links to the theory behind it.
