# ==================================================
# Versioning
# ==========
#
# MAJOR Major number for this branch.
#
# MINOR The most recent interface number this
#     library implements.
#
# COMPATMINOR The latest binary compatible minor number
#     this library implements.
#
# PATCH The implementation number of the current interface.
#
#
# - The package VERSION will be MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
#
# - Libtool's -version-info will be derived from MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH
#   and COMPATMINOR (see configure.ac).
#
# - Changing MAJOR always breaks binary compatibility.
#
# - Changing MINOR doesn't break binary compatibility by default.
#   Only if COMPATMINOR is changed as well.
#
#
# 1) After branching from TRUNK increment TRUNKs MAJOR and
#    start with version `MAJOR.0.0' and also set COMPATMINOR to 0.
#
# 2) Update the version information only immediately before a public release
#    of your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee
#    that the current interface number gets larger faster.
#
# 3) If the library source code has changed at all since the last update,
#    then increment PATCH.
#
# 4) If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
#    update, increment MINOR, and set PATCH to 0.
#
# 5) If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
#    leave COMPATMINOR unchanged. (binary compatible change)
#
# 6) If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then
#    set COMPATMINOR to MINOR. (binary incompatible change)
